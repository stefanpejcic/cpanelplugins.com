cpanelplugins.com website is a fork of Gridsome.org and is hosted on netlify.

I created this website as an alternative to Cpanel AppCatalog because it hasn't been updated in years and of you want to submit a plugin, their review process takes weeks.

The website creates a plugin page for each github repo added inside plugins.yaml file

### Have a plugin that you would like to add to cpanelplugins.com ?

To get your plugin listed, the following is required:

- Your plugin must be publicly available on Github.
- An installation script titled "installer.sh" must be included in the main branch.


To add your plugin:

1. Fork this repo [stefanpejcic/cpanelplugins.com](https://github.com/stefanpejcic/cpanelplugins.com)
2. Add your plugin information to the plugins/plugins.yaml file
3. Make a pull request with the following title: ADD PLUGIN


Hopefully cpanelplugins.com will soon also include other peoples plugins as well, and not just my own. ðŸ˜„
